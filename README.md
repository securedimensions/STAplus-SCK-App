# Smart Citizen Kit publishes on STAplus
The application `SensorApp` publishes observations from the Smart Citizen Kit v2.1 to a SensorThings PLUS API endpoint.

**DISCLAIMER: This software is in development stage and therefore probably buggy. Please report issues to improve the code**
## Hardware
To run the application, a Raspberry PI or another computer running Linux or MAC OS is required.
In addition, the Smart Citizen Kit v2.1 as made available from Fablab Barcelona is required.

### Connect the Hardware
Connect the Smart Citizen Kit v2.1 with a decent USB cable to your computer.
Then find the `tty` (using `ls /dev/tty*`) that makes the serial communication to the Smart Citizen Kit available:

* Raspberry PI: The Smart Citizen Kit typically connects as `/dev/ttyACM0`
* MAC OS: The Smart Citizen Kit connects as `/dev/tty.usbmodem<number>` where the `number` is subject to change

## Installation
The following installation is tested on a Raspberry PI 4 with Python 3.9 installed.

### Clone this repository
First, `cd` into your favorite directory and then clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/securedimensions/STAplus-SCK-App.git` and change into the directory with `cd STAplus-SCK-App`.

Before continuing, please setup a Python virtual environment using `python3 -m venv .` and activate the virtual environment with `source bin/activate`.

### Install Python dependencies
To install the dependencies, simply execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Install Rust (optional)
After finishing the installation of all dependencies, please make sure that the Python `cryptography` module installed. 

If the `cryptography` module did not install in the previous step, it needs to be compiled from source. To allow `pip` to compile the module, it is important to install a Rust compiler >= v1.56.0 first. 

Please follow the howto from the [Rust homepage](https://rustup.rs) and then repeat the installation of dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Configure the Application
The configuration must be done in the source code ;)

The file `SensorApp.py` contains the line 57 the number for your SCK kit that you received from the registration with `https://start.smartcitizen.me`. Please update the variable `kit_id` with your number if you are using a new SCK that has not been registered before!

The file `SensorApp.py` contains the line 58 the variable `location` that is used to set the location of the `Thing` and `FeatureOfInterest`. Please update as you see fit!

```python
location = staPlus.Location(name="Munich", description="A nice place on Earth", location=Point((11.509234,48.1107284)), encoding_type='application/geo+json')
```

### Run the Application
The application can be started from the terminal window using:

```shell
python SensorApp.py
```

The required authentication with AUTHENIX is started via the default Web-Browser. In case the Web-Browser does not open automatically (e.g. over ssh -X connections), open the URL displayed in the terminal in the Web-Browser.

Once authenticated, the application will create a STAplus `Party` entity representing you. The `Party`'s property `displayName` will be set from the value of the OpenID claim `preferred_username` received from authentication. The value for this claim was displayed during approval for this application.

Please follow these steps to start the application after the Raspberry restarted:

```shell
cd STAplus-SCK-App
source bin/activate
nohup python SensorApp.py &
# In Web-Browser, sign-in via Authenix
# Close web page
ctrl+C
```

### Run the Application in the background
To continue the execution of the application, please use the following command from the terminal window:

```shell
nohup python SensorApp.py &
```

To verify that the application is running, you can use `ps -ef|grep python`.

You can now logout from the Raspberry...


## Application publishing data
Once the application is started it will publish the following observations every 10 seconds:

* Air Temperature
* Air Humidity
* Atmospheric Pressure
* Noise
* Light intensity
* PM 1
* PM 2.5
* PM 10

The [CitiObs STAplus demo endpoint](https://citiobs.demo.secure-dimensions.de/staplus/v1.1) is used to publish the observations. Please find **your** Datastreams to evaluate the published observations.

### Stopping the Application
If started in the foreground, the execution can be aborted using `CTRL-C` from the keyboard.

If started in the background, you need to obtain the `process_id` via `ps -ef|grep python` and use `kill <process_id>` to stop the application.

### Troubleshooting
Please to try resolve the issue reported in the terminal window and run the application again. If nothing helps, please create an issue.

### Appreciation
Work on this project has being funded by the European Commission under Horizon Europe project [CitiObs](https://www.citiobs.eu).
